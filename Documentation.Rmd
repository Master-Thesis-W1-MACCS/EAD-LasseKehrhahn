1. NUMB_C =       Customer = `R 01 INIT(EAD$NUMB_C)`   
2. NUMB_CN =      Customer Needs

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
